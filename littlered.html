          <p>I imagined Red and her grandma as crazy outlaws that were trying to outrun justice after very recently robbing a bank, but the law is following very close behind trying to catch them before they can enjoy their loot. In this case, the big bad Wolf is now the Sheriff now desperately trying to catch up and get them before it’s too late.

              I had recently been playing a game called Cuphead at the time of making this concept and was heavily inspired by that art style. This style would allow for a fun way of depicting Red and her grandma as the crazy bad guys in the situation. To begin with, I put together a bunch of references of the old wild west and 1920’s/Cuphead art style. Based on these references, I began sketching different concepts for what my three characters may look like. After these sketches, I digitally created what I thought the final design of the characters might look like and tried different colours on them. Red took me the longest to get how I wanted because I wanted her outfit to accurately represent that she is Red Riding Hood.

          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><p>
              <br><br>
With this came the planning on the setting for the final drawing. I put together various compositions to test which would be the most aesthetically pleasing and best at telling a story for the final drawing. Some of the compositions involved Red and grandma engaging in an old western shoot-out with the sheriff Wolf, and others showed them making a dash for it. I liked the idea of movement in the final image so chose to have them running away while the Wolf scowls after them, knowing they have once again bested him this time.
