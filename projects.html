I have technical coding skills (HTML, CSS, C#), and I am experienced in all industry-standard applications required to get work done to a high standard. I love all areas of design but my favourite aspects would be web design and app design. If I sound like the perfect fit for your project, shoot me an email down at the bottom of the page!</p>

                  <p class="thumbnailText">VegOut is a concept that I came up with from the personal struggle of someone who hasn’t eaten meat in a decade.

                  <p class="thumbnailText">For this project of portraying character expressions, I worked to familiarise myself with moving 3D rigs to convey convincing emotions. The purpose of this was to home in on how a character’s face and body would look when they feel a specific emotion, and how I would make that visually interesting to the viewer.</p>
