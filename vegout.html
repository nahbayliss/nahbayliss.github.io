          <p class="subpageWhiteP">VegOut is a concept that I came up with from the personal struggle of someone who hasn’t eaten meat in a decade. People with dietary requirements struggle to find places to go out to eat that can cater to them and often feel like the odd-one-out in public with friends and family.</p>

          <p>Vegout’s concept is available both in website form and app form. The main functions of this brand is to find restaurants based on specific locations that can be filtered by your dietary requirements. I wanted this project to be a positive spin on the vegan and vegetarian lifestyles, as there is a negative stigma that currently surrounds those that choose to live this lifestyle. While it mainly caters to those on vegetarian diets, there are more filters for people with other dietary requirements (for example, halal). I wanted to encourage acceptance for those that have dietary needs, whether it be by moral choice or food intolerances/allergies.
              <br>
              <br>
To begin this project, I started researching competitors, and analysing their strengths and weaknesses. I noticed that VegOut could potentially fill a gap on the market for a free-to-use service that offered information on dietary-inclusive restaurants. I began to consider all the potential stakeholder that would be invested in this project. This would benefit various groups of people such as: people with dietary requirements, family and friends, restaurant owners,  and those that want to give plant-based food options a try. I then did surveys on people asking about their dietary requirements and how difficult it is to find food that they can enjoy when out in public. Those that ate meat reported little to no struggle, while those that fell into the vegetarian category faced a noticeable struggle.

In order to begin designing, I started with visual investigations. These allow me to put together styles of typography, colours, texture, imagery, and element styles to get a feel for the direction that the final branding will go in. Two of my investigations followed a more traditional style in relation to natural greenery that is associated with vegetarian lifestyles, and my other investigation was more unconventional in the attempt to break out of people’s preconceived notions of these lifestyles. I ended up liking the use of bright colours that represented fruits and vegetables, and a soft organic style to let users know that this is an open-minded place trying to break down stigma.
              <br>
              <br>
Once this stage was complete, I created wireframes for what both my website and my app would look like in terms of layout. This helped me to get a feel of what the most important things the user would expect from this service. The main goals of the user were to be able to search by location, filter by their food choices, view these places on a map, and read reviews of restaurants.

          </div>
          
          
          <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"> <p>
              <br><br>
The final design comps for VegOut’s website and app varied slightly from the wireframe for the purpose of usability. I maintained a consistent brand identity on both platforms so that a user would feel comfortable switching between using both if need be. I also created my own illustrations for this brand in order to maintain a consistent organic imagery style. If VegOut became a real existing brand, it would maintain itself by selling merch on their shop. The shop would be available both on the website and app. I created two variations of T-shirts that people could buy: a white shirt with an official illustration on it, and a black shirt with the logo on it. People would also be able to buy a jet-tag style keyring with the VegOut logo on it. To promote VegOut I also created a Facebook page to reach a wide audience and inform them about the brand.
