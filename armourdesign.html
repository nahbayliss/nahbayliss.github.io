          <p>This was prepared as if this character would then be sent to a 3D modeller to sculpt. The character that I designed here is a girl in a modern post-apocalypse setting. I went for a realistic armour approach and thought about what someone really in this situation would carry on them.
              <br>
              <br>
When starting this assignment, I first put together a lot of references together on Pinterest in relation to post-apocalyptic themed clothing and settings, and references for posing. After I had a lot of different sources to refer to, I began with the creation of silhouettes. Silhouettes are great in character design for coming up with interestingly shaped characters. This helps to make the design more visually appealing. These have little to no detail except the plain shape, and I came up with 11 different silhouettes.

          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><p>
              <br><br>
Based on my favourite silhouettes, I started developing three different characters. This allowed me to test out different armour styles and weapon styles, as well as posing styles. These were quick development sketches for the sake of figuring out which armour and weapon style would make the cut for my final character. I liked the thought of my character having a bow. I thought it would be hard to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation where others are trying to attack you without some form of long-range weapon. It is possible to retrieve shot arrows sometimes whereas you can’t do that with gun bullets, so this would be more convenient for the character.
              <br>
              <br>
After the completion of the development sketches, I began with the creation of the model turnaround. This is to show the character and her armour from every angle, in order to make 3D modelling this character easy to reference back to. This would also include accessories, such as a backpack (which would be removed in one angle drawing to see what is underneath). The completed turnaround also had the weapon next to the character shown for scale.

              </p>
          </div>
          </div>
          
          
          <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"> <p>
              <br><br>
Based on feedback from my tutor and other students, I made adjustments to my character, mostly to do with anatomical corrections. After my turnaround looked anatomically correct, came the drawing of the final render. Based on the poses in my references, I created a drawing of my character standing hostile as she draws an arrow from her backpack. I spent a lot of time trying to get the anatomy of my character correct. I also focused on foreshortening the bow weapon to make the drawing feel more 3D. I added bruising and blood spatter to also indicate that she had recently been in combat.
