          <p>Putting together this book first involved the creation of a proposal. This proposal set the grounds for what Guiding Design would achieve and the style guide to go along with it. It was intended to be the perfect little handbook for designers without being patronizing or pretentious. I saw this project as potentially being something that could be updated over the years with new information and could be a collectible. With this in mind I used 2019’s Pantone colour of the year, Living Coral. If this was updated again I would re-design it focusing on the current Pantone colour of the year. </p>

To begin with my research, I first investigated other resources that offered advice on professional printing. I analysed what they did well in terms of both information and aesthetics and compared them against one another. After this I started carrying out visual investigations to get an idea of the design direction I would go in. This included various textures, colours, grid layouts, print finishes. I also created three fictional personas. Each persona was fleshed out to seem like a realistic person that would interact with my print guide. I tried to imagine what each person would expect to gain from reading my print guide.
              <br>
              <br>
After this came the design development. I sketched out on paper different concepts for the logo, patterns, and icons. I would then go into Adobe Illustrator and finalise these concepts. With these completed concepts I put them together into the style guide while deciding on the colour and fonts that Guiding Design would take on.

The completed book had an extended length on the front cover that was bent to serve as a bookmark if the reader wanted to save their page. If I was creating this book now, having learned from the past, I would have either chosen a smaller GSM for the outer cover or an entirely different paper stock. The folds on the outer cover have cracked and you can see the white underneath. I would have also chosen to go with perfect binding instead of saddle stitch as it would make it easier to read due to the sheer amount of content in Guiding Design. One more thing that I would change is I would delve more into setting up documents in InDesign. I touched on the basics, for example printer marks and bleed/slug, but I would like to add more information on things such as grid layout, colour libraries, paragraph settings, etc.
