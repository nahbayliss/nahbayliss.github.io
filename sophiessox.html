          <p>I provided Sophie’s Sox with a style guide for their brand re-design. I also provided prototypes of potential touchpoints that the brand could offer: Stickers, bags, sock packaging, and business cards. With a new brand design, Sophie’s Sox would then get a new website redesign based on the new style guide. This all started off with an interview with the client about what they expected from their brand redesign.
              <br>
              <br>
To begin the rebrand, I started researching into businesses that shared similarities to Sophie’s Sox and into the production of socks. For example, from 2015 to 2018, there was an increase by 1000% for the sales of brightly coloured and novelty socks. I did brand comparisons of those that were like Sophie’s Sox by looking critically into their message and aesthetic design. I then created an identity summary for what I thought this brand represented. Following this was the creation of three different personas. These were fictional people that I created that would represent the types of people that would interact with the brand. This helped to home in on what makes people buy from Sophie’s Sox and how I could make a design that could appeal to them.

Following this research phase, I began creating visual investigations of the design directions I could go in for the brand. Sophie’s Sox creates quirky and colourful socks, so I based my visual investigations around that. After getting a feel for the design direction I would go in, I started the development phase of designing. This began with various sketches of patterns and logos. I then took these concepts and recreated them in Illustrator. I had a few different concepts to choose from. I then developed the graphics and typography that would be used in the final design. I chose Knewave as the main font because of its soft, organic shape giving a personal handwritten feel to the design. I based my patterns on 80s/90s design to represent the different kinds of patterned socks that the brand offers.
              <br>
              <br>
The final logo for Sophie’s Sox that I designed had a personal hand-made feel to it. I created an image of a foot with the centre of it being shaped into a heart. This represents the love that goes into running the brand. The stripes on the rest of the foot represent the patterned socks and looks like the heart is radiating. I went with a primary colour scheme for the brand as it would appeal to the wide range of personas I had created. I added a light pink to represent the femininity of the brand owner, Sophie, and represent the love that had gone into this business.

              <br><br>
For the touchpoints, I wanted to create something that would be easy for a microbusiness like Sophie’s Sox to afford and manufacture. They go out to markets to sell their socks often, so I think that putting a logo sticker on a paper bag would be a cost-effective way for the brand to put sold items into these bags to sell to customers and encourage them to remember Sophie’s Sox. I also created business cards for the brand. These would be great to give out at markets or send with order parcels. Importantly, the packaging of an item can make an impression on a customer. I created a double-sided card that could be hole punched for the sock packaging. When the socks are rolled up neatly to be sold, you can thread string through the hole punches and wrap it around the socks to maintain their shape. One side of the card is a thank-you note from Sophie, and the other side explains the type of socks that the customer has purchased.
